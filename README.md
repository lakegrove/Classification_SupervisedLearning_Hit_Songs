# Metis Music Festival


#### Question/need:
* The purpose of my model will be to use Spotify features to figure out what will be a hit song and therefore Artists to book for an upcoming music festival I want to put on in the summer of 2021.  By looking at what Songs are the best across Genres, festivals can book the best spread of artists to maximize attendance and revenues for the festival while providing high quality music and potential artist collaboration.

By identifying good artists or artisits that are simiilar we can have an idea of who we can target.  And if we can't get the top line artists we can find artists with similar sound to fill in place. 

#### Data Description:
* I plan to aquire data from the Spotify application using packages and/or code to access the Spotify API to get features for songs and Artists. 

* I expect to work with things like spotify's own meaures of Danceability, Energy, Key, Loudness, Speechiness, Acoustiness, Instrumnetalness and others.  

* The target will be whether the song is a hit or not.  We may also be interetsed in identifying genres so we can figure out who belongs to what genre so we have a balanced line up.

Spotify API
Tableau
Excel

Seaborn


#### MVP Goal:
* Ideas for a minimum viable product might be groupings of similar artist to create pools from which we can choose.  It also could be a list of songs we think will be hits and look for the largest hits or most hits per artists as a basis for creating a pool to select from.
